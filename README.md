# Hullathatty FC — React Boilerplate

This repository contains a Vite + React boilerplate converted from a single-page HTML (originally using Tailwind CSS). The project uses a single `src/styles.css` file (no Tailwind) and componentized React structure.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`.

## Structure
- `public/index.html` — fonts and root HTML.
- `src/` — React source.
- `src/styles.css` — single CSS file.
- `package.json` — scripts.

## Notes
- Images currently point to Unsplash. Replace with local assets in `src/assets/` if desired.
- Add FontAwesome or another icon library into `public/index.html` if you want icons.
